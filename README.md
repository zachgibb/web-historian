#web-historian
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This was a solo project. In this project, I rewrote part of http://archive.org, a web service that archives sites on the internet. This allows users to submit a URL, and I archive it (by getting a copy of that website off of the internet and writing it to a local text file) and show them your copy.
